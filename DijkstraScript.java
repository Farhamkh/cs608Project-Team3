/* Hello, and welcome to the walkthrough of the Dijkstra java code. 
The Dijkstra algorithm is a searching algorithm that finds the shortest distance 
in a graph from an initial root node to other neighbor nodes in the graph.
It is commonly used in applications such as Digital mapping (Google Maps),
 Network Systems, and Flight Coordination Platforms.
Let's get started! */

        a String type input for a String type representation of the initial point of

                and value of the currentNode being pritned first, before the neighbor name 
                and values are printed. Here, we see that the value of distance is 
                a sum of the integers currentDistance and weight. This is because Dijkstra's 
                Algorithm only runs with nodes that have non-negative weights. */

                /* If you remember the previous slides in the presentation (slide x), 
                Components are Nodes, Edges, and Weights; Nodes are The points of intersection 
                within a network; Edges are The relationships between the nodes within a network; 
                Weights are The "cost" associated with the edge. 
                
                The limitations of Djikstraâ€™s algorithm are that the graph 
                should be weighted and the weights should be non-negative. 

                This explains the value of the integer, "distance", which can be explained to be the 
                sum of the integers "currentDistance" and "weight". Dijkstra's 
                Algorithm runs only for weighted graphs, and weights of non-negative value.
                Hence, every Map<String, Integer> object, "neighbor",
                has a variable int "weight" that must be factored in, as weights are also non-negative by
                design. "The shortest path tree identified using Dijkstra's technique will attempt to avoid edges with bigger
                weights because they indicate that the edge has a large weight/cost". 
                Djikstra's Algorithm has dis-advantages of being time-consuming: it
                takes time to conduct a blind search, unable to handle negative weights,
                and doesn't work well on nonuniformed graphs. */

                                        not the same as the distance from a node "Y" to a node "X".
                                        This is because in the traversal path, the weights of the nodes must be 
                                        accounted for when calculating the distance, as shown in the code in line (**).
                                        Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the shortest path from the root node to 
                                        the destination node, is the same as the distance calculated traversing via iteration.

                                        // As stated above, the shortest distance from node "A" to node "D" is not calculated as:
                                        //  The distance from node "A" to node "B" to node "D", because there was no traversal from node "B" to node "D", 
                                        and the resulting traversal from node "A" to node "B" to node "C" to node "D" would be 3 + 7 + 6 = 16, which is twice greater than 7
                                        //  The distance from node "A" to node "B" to node "D", because there were no traversal paths from node "A" to node "B", nor from node "B" to node "D". 


Given all of its considerations, there are best and worst case uses for Dijkstra's Algorithm.
It has a run-time complexity of O(m log n) when implemented with a binary heap (source: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anupamg/advalgos15/lectures/lecture04.pdf)
which can be improved to a run-time complexity of O(m + n log n) time with a Fibonacci heap. 
It is better than another Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm, 
which has run-time complexity of O(m*n). 
However, in comparison against All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) algorithms such as Johnson's Algorithm, which has
a run-time complexity of O(mn + n2 log log n), which is achieved running Dijkstra's Algorithm n times,
and Floyd-Marshall's Algorithm which has a run-time complexity of O(n3), it is much better.
